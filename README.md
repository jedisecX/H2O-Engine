# 🔋 Stanley Meyer-Inspired Water Fuel Cell Retrofit System

A full-featured, open-source retrofit system to convert any Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) to run on **on-demand HHO gas** generated from water using a high-frequency voltage resonance system, inspired by Stanley Meyer's fuel cell design.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is for **educational** and **experimental** purposes. Use with caution and observe all safety protocols when working with high voltage and combustible gases.

## 🛠️ Engine Modifications

1. **Ignition Timing**: Retard ~10–15° BTDC
2. **Fuel Cutoff**: Disable fuel pump or injectors
3. **Sensor Overrides** (ECU): Clamp or spoof MAF, O2 sensors if required
4. **Add Flashback Arrestors**: At cell output and engine intake
5. **Tune Intake**: Optimize air/fuel ratio with vacuum-controlled HHO injection
